  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I love playing guitar and learning. I'm also a big fan of being in nature. <br />
    I've lived in San Diego my whole life but love traveling to other states. <br />
    I picked up coding because I love over coming challenges and want to secure both <br />
    my family and personal financial future. <br />
  </p>
  
  <h2>The Appalachian Trail</h2>

  <p>In 2024, I decided to take a break from "normal life" and take a hike. This was no ordinary hike however. <br />
    Only 1 in 4 people attempting this 2,200 mile hike through diverse weather conditions succeed a thru-hike.<br />
    Completing this monumental challenge showed me many of my flaws and strengths. I hope to do it again <br />
    in the future! <br />
